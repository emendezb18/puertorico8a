    <p class="parrafo3">Puerto Rico has been home to a thriving street art movement for more than a decade. This movement has helped international and local artists to depict dynamic and expressive murals on the streets. For this reason, tourists can enjoy colorful and vivid artistic pieces, one of them being “Sangre y Resistencia'' by Vecino Cintrón and many being by Dama Lola. <br><br>
    
        “Sangre y Resistencia” by Vecino Cintrón is a striking mural in Paseo Amor in Ponce which was painted using only red, black, and yellow. Cinturón’s work focuses on re-creating historical imagery, and so the mural honors "Los héroes del 25 de Enero," a squad of firefighters imprisoned for disobedience after putting out el Fuego del Polvorin in Ponce, also considered to be one of Puerto Rico’s most illustrious fires. The tourists can also witness that the mural depicts both Cintrón's distinctive style and the history of the town. <br><br>

    Damaris Cruz, famously known as Dama Lola, has many of her murals and pieces of art scattered around the town of Dorado and Yauco where she makes use of abandoned old houses to recreate charming memories of Puerto Rico’s rural life. Dama Lola’s canvas portrays a blend of elements including elements of photography, painting, and decoupage. You’ll also find her work near Dorado beach, where she hosts workshops for students who want to learn about muralism. <br><br>

Street art is essential when visiting Puerto Rico. It helps tourists to picture and learn more about history in a fun and different way. Remember to take pictures!<br></br>
