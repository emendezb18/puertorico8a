    <p class="parrafo3">The Ponce massacre was an event that took place on Palm Sunday, March 21, 1937, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, when a peaceful march became into a killing of 19 people, 2 policemen and more than 200 civilians wounded. Most of the dead were reported shot in the back. The march had been organized to commemorate the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873. After investigating they blamed the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Blanton Winship. This led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remove Whinship as governor in 1939. The Ponce massacre remains the largest massacre in Spanish imperial history in Puerto Rico.</p><br><br>
