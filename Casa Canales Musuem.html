    <p class="parrafo3">Every country has its history. A set of important events with main personalities whose actions, often heroic, forever change the course of the country. We can see them in monuments, museums, theme parks, schools, sports stadiums, and even cemeteries, but this one is unique, it talks about leaders that changed the course of the independence revolution forever.<br><br>

        Jayuya is a nice little town in the middle of the La Cordillera Central mountain range. It is remote, green, and lovely, and is rich in archaeological history, but it is also rich in more recent history. On the same property as the =Cemi Museum is the Museo Casa Canales. It was at this house where a short, but proud, freedom uprising took place in 1950. Today, it is an interesting museum that shows the Canales family life, work, and political beliefs. The independentists of Puerto Rico are people who believe that Puerto Rico should be an independent nation. Blanca Canales was one of the leaders of the revolution of October 30, 1950. She lived in Casa Canales Museum, the starting point for her and the nationalists. In the house they kept the weapons and ammunition they used to reach the plaza and raise the Puerto Rican flag, shouting live! Puerto Rico is free! The standoff in this small house lasted 3 days until the US National Guard was called and Canales, her family, and the independentists were arrested. The history of this house is incomparable, tourists are going to enjoy every single bit of it while observing and visiting the house, an important part of Puerto Ricoâ€™s Independence Revolution will be remembered.</p><br><br>
