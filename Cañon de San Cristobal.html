    <p class="parrafo3">Considered to be one of the ten wonders of Puerto Rico, San Cristobal is the deepest canyon in the Caribbean with 90-100 million-year-old geological formations. It is located on a 3.4km trail that runs between the towns of Aibonito and Barranquitas. It was formed by erosion due to the water systems consisting of waterfalls and it is home to many wildlife species, 144 animals (indigenous animals as part of it), and 696 plant species. The canyon is rich in soil which maintains and assists the ecosystem. This canyon became a protected area in 1978 by the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust because of its ecological value and need for preservation, therefore, accessibility may differ and some routes need permission to tour them.<br><br>

The canyon has many activities tourists can accomplish that will make their trip unforgettable, for this reason, we recommend tourists to accomplish the following activities in order for their trip to be fascinating: Hiking: When hiking, people will encounter beautiful views and a sensational environment during their climbing. Different types of landscapes will expose the rocky texture of the canyon, the greens surrounding them, and the mint color from the waterfalls, one of them being La Niebla which is one of the tallest in Puerto Rico having a height of 240 ft, and the eye appealing rock pools.<br><br>

Rappelling: After hiking, it is time to start rappelling. First, people will go down to the smooth rocks of ‘Salto de la Cabra’ and then when we already reach ‘Charco Azul’ (Blue Pool), there is the option to jump or rappel down the river below. This pleasurable site should be on your to-do’s when planning a visit to Puerto Rico. Have a nice time!</p><br><br>
