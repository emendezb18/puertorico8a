    <p class="parrafo3">Known for its soaring interiors, million-year-old stalactites, and stalagmites, and namesake underground river, Rio Camuy Cave Park (Parque Nacional de las Cavernas del RÃ­o Camuy) in Puerto Rico attracts nature lovers and casual visitors alike. The 268-acre (108-hectare) complex is most famous for its cave tour, but it also offers picnic pavilions, walking trails, and a playground.<br><br>

    Its three crater-shaped sinkholes are open to visitors from the Rio Camuy, which attracts many tourists because it is the third largest cave system in the world. Tourists can easily access the site from San Juan since less will be given a tour of the caves led by a park ranger who offers information about the history of the area in a quick way so that tourists can listen to the flow of the Camuy River. In the end, if the tourists want, they can stop at the Arecibo Observatory where the world's largest radio telescope used by astronomers to study space is located. If you want to learn about the third largest cave system in the world, this is the perfect place for you. What are you waiting for?</p><br><br>
