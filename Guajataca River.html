    <p class="parrafo3">Guajataca River is a river in Lares, Puerto Rico. It is situated on the island's northwest shore in Isabella municipality. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean from the south and it flows into Guajataca Beach, creating a natural pool where people take the opportunity to swim, play in the water, or kayak.<br><br>

        The history of this river dates back to before Christopher Columbus arrived to colonize. The Guajataca River was a name the indigenous people gave, specifically the Taino. Because of its size: height of roughly 1,600 feet, and length of about 25.5 miles, kayaking is an activity often practiced by tourists. The path begins at Guajataca Beach, where the river empties, when the Kayaks are thrown onto the natural pool, the exciting and memorable adventure begins. Along the way, you can observe the nature that lies there such as the flora, the different rocks, and the fauna (turtles, ducks, butterflies, etc). It is a beautiful and quiet path that will make you connect with nature while exercising your body. During the journey, there are several places where stops can be made, both to rest and to dive into the area. There are trees where you can sit, rope to jump on, and a nice swing hanging from a tree where tourists can get beautiful photos and remember their childhood.<br><br>
        
        Get ready because when you visit the Guajataca River you will not have a single drop of energy left. What are you waiting for? <br><br>
