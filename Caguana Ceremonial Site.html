    <p class="parrafo3">The Taíno people populated most of the Caribbean and some surrounding territories during the pre-Columbian era and long before. After being enslaved and infected by diseases, the Tainos were exterminated but even so, they left a deep legacy in the Puerto Rican culture, being rescued by the government, creating in their honor, in the year 2016, the Taino route, recognizing and highlighting this way his great inheritance. From north to south and through the central mountainous areas, the route offers a glimpse of the ceremonial centers, tombs, caves, and petroglyphs of the Taínos such as The Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Center, a historical site having petroglyphs created by the Tainos.<br><br>

    The Caguana Ceremonial Site dates back to the prehistoric and early contact period of Puerto Rico. This type of site is the largest in the West Indies and is located in the central-western rainy mountains on the east side of the Tanama River, in Barrio Caguana. Declared a place of balance and reparation for tourists in 1955 by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, the Ceremonial Site of Caguana is one of the most interesting sites since it has bateyes, 10 plazas, 21 petroglyphs and utensils made by the Taínos. If you are one who loves to connect and know about religion, the Taino Route is the perfect place for you!</p><br><br>
