    <p class="parrafo3">Salsa is a mixture of Caribbean rhythms such as guaracha, mambo, pachanga, guajira, guaguancó, chachachá, Afro-Cuban percussion, and Spanish pop tunes. The origins of salsa began with the emigration of Cubans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans to the US, the New York neighborhood, and the Latin American reality were some of the themes with which salsa began to invade the clubs of New York and Puerto Rico.<br><br>

        The Tourism Company has had the idea of inviting and attracting tourists to participate in the "Ruta de la salsa" due to the value this gives and because it also helps tourists learn about this musical genre. Learning it means that tourists will have the opportunity to dance, sing, feel the rhythm and enjoy its fascinating rhythm that is so attractive to foreigners from all over the world. During this memorable experience, the visitors can dance salsa at night in the Coca-Cola Music Hall which we highly recommend because it is a modern live-music center owned and opened in 2021 by the Puerto Rico Convention Center District Authority; a government agency of Puerto Rico, and managed by ASM Global. In this hall, people are going to have a great time with locals while having some beverages and Salsa live shows with music from Frankie Ruiz, Eddie Santiago, and Tito Nieves.<br><br>
        
        Why have you been waiting for? Go dancing, and dance your heart out to shake it off!<br><br>
