    <p class="parrafo3">Tourists are satisfied every time they visit Puerto Rico and its restaurants. The culture and the good vibes of Puerto Rico are always served in all the meals that it contains, those flavors always mix, the food melts in your mouth, and fortunately, tourists have the opportunity to feel and taste how welcoming the traditional foods of Puerto Rico are; even Barack Obama himself! One of the most popular is the tremble.<br><br>
    
    Tembleque or Coconut Pudding in English is a Puerto Rican dessert that translates to "wiggly or tremble." Its ingredients include coconut milk, heavy cream, cornstarch, sugar, and coconut. Cinnamon is added on top. It is one of the desserts served at the celebration of the Navida, which lasts 45 days on the island starting from November on Thanksgiving day, until mid-January, and culminating with the Fiestas de la Calle San Sebasti√°n. A great and extraordinary place to try Tembleque in Puerto Rico is Kasalta, a bakery situated in San Juan. There you can try one of the best or if not the best, Tembleque of Puerto Rico! Wanna feel the wiggling feeling of Tembleque and how delicious traditional food is, visit Puerto Rico!<br><br>
