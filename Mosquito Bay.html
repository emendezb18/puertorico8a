            <p class="parrafo3">Bay, also known as Puerto Mosquito in Spanish, has been a National Natural Landmark since 1980 located on the southern part of Vieques island. It is known as the “brightest island” by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2008 and one of the 7 wonders of Earth in 2020. It was formed from the sediment of a coral reef, which has been there for millions of years on the uninhabited island.<br><br>

            The unique history is what attracts tourists the most, especially the story behind its name. Mosquito Bay was named after the Mosquito, one of Roberto Cofresi’s (the last successful pirate of the Caribbean) ships. As one of the three bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico and one of the five bioluminescent bays in the world, it is crucial to understand why this magical and appealing shimmering glow-in-the-dark effect happens every time water is in contact. Mosquito Bay’s glow is caused by a single organism called dinoflagellates, which are big enough to cause movement and color when coming in contact with water. For this reason, we recommend tourists to enjoy the beautiful landscape views and breathtaking beauty from this site with the following activities: fishing, kayaking, and scuba diving, which indeed is the best plot to accomplish such a task on the whole island. This beautiful place is a must when planning a trip. I hope you visit the magical glow of Puerto Rico!</p></br>
